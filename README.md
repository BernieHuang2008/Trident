# Introduction
The Trident is a web compiler for latex that compiles latex into HTML in real time.

# Warning
From algorithm to the result, Trident is completely different from the others. It's not a serious Latex compiler, so it cannot act like other compilers *(i.e. cannot display the correct layout like the others)* and can't produce the pdf file either.

**Please don't use it in the real work.**
